                    Today's plan was to actually make something cohesive.
                    I'd played with particles, level sequences, modeling in Unreal Engine. Now was the time to put it all together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I decided to work on the first echo that the player would find. You start in a small room with an echo object on the desk.
                    When you interact with it, you see a ghostly figure of a woman sitting in the chair next to you, brushing her hair.
                    After a few seconds, a child appears at the door way. A few seconds later, they both disappear.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wa able to get this all working. There's a few things I want to tweak, such as the brightness of the particles.
                    The effect isn't quite what I had in mind. Rather than a hologram effect, I want to go for more of a ghostly, wisp effect.
                    But that's something I can tweak as I go on. It was important to get the mechanics working first.

                    I think the next step will be lighting. The sky is either far too bright, or the interior is far too dark. I need
                    to find the right balance that sets the atmosphere I'm going for.

                    Since I decided to move to first person, I decided to further reduce the complexity by removing animations from the echo playbacks.
                    It's not what I wanted, but by making them static and more like a comic book, I can focus on more area of the game rather than worrying about animating several different characters.
                    They will also take a more ghostly form, removing the need to worry about clothing for these characters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also started playing about with Niagara, Unreals particle system. I spent way too much time on this, playing around with various settings.
                    Eventually, I decided to stop what I was doing and go back to the basics. Instead of the glowing orb that the character can pick up, it will be a simple sphere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tomorrow, I'll get to actually putting together the various mechanics that will make the game work.

                    Having gotten the cutscene working, I wanted to look more in to animations. I'd played with them years ago using Blender, so I wasn't new to it.
                    However, I knew how complex they could get.
                    This led me to look at <a href="https://cascadeur.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cascadeur</a>, a program where you can create animations, and have AI fill in the blanks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I played with Cascadeur for a few hours, and I was able to create a basic walk cycle. However, progress was slow, and glitchy at times.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because of this, I decided to make a drastic decision. The game, which I had envisioned in third person, would be first person.
                    I would prefer a third person game, but making it first person simplifies a lot of things.
                    I wouldn't need to worry about animations for the player character, including facial animations. Cutscenes would be easier to create.
                    I wouldn't have to worry about animations for movement, how the character looks etc.
                    The houses you visit in the game would also be quite small, given they are old miners homes. Keeping the game in third person means the houses
                    would need to be bigger than usual to accommodate the camera.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Given this shift, I decided to create a new first person project and start from there.

                    I've decided to start with interactions. Being able to interact with an object and have something happen.
                    It was simple enough really. Create a blueprint, add a collision overlap sphere and enable input when the character overlaps.
                    Once that's done, I can trigger anything with the press of an Input Action.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next part I wanted to explore was a cutscene. I have a vision in my head, so I wanted to try and get this working.
                    I looked in to Level Sequences and animations. I was able to get a basic animation working for the character, and moving the camera using keyframes.
                    I was also able to get this Level Sequence to trigger when the player interacts with an object (with much hassle).
                </p>
                <p>
                    After this, I called it a day. I was happy with what I had achieved, and I was excited to continue working on it tomorrow.

                    I knew this would be a big project going in, but I didn't realise how big. I'd never used Unreal Engine before, but I was keen to learn.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having dove head first in to Unreal, the scope of the project became clearer as the days went on.
                    From blueprints, animations, particles, materials, and more, I was quickly overwhelmed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, I decided to focus on the smallest piece I could. I already had a story, and a rough idea of the first 10 minutes or so of the game.
                    This would be the prototype I would build. Something small that I could focus on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this in mind, I started to think about the parts that I would need to build this prototype.
                    Thinks like grey-boxed houses and interiors, basic movement, interaction etc. Breaking it down to this small prototype
                    made the project seem much more manageable.
