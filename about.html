                    Set in a 1913 North Eastern UK mining village of Hollow Pines, Whispers of The Hollow follows Clara Hensley, a woman drawn to the town by inexplicable nightmares and haunting whispers. As she explores its abandoned ruins, she begins to uncover long-buried secrets, experiencing supernatural echoes, residual imprints of the past. As she pieces together the village’s dark history, she realizes that she is not merely an observer, she is part of it.

                    At the heart of Hollow Pines’ ruin lurks The Hollow, an ancient, insatiable entity that feeds on memory and emotion. One night, something awakened it fully, and the entire town was consumed in an instant. The people of Hollow Pines vanished without a trace, their existence erased, leaving behind only fragments of their pain and regret, the very echoes Clara perceives. The deeper she ventures, the more The Hollow and its twisted manifestations toy with her mind, distorting reality and luring her deeper into its grasp.

                    Plagued by visions of a place she does not recall, Clara is inexplicably drawn to Hollow Pines. Her nightmares occur every night, and she hears whispers in the shadows. Her nightmares always included the presence of a young girl, standing there, motionless. There’s a vague familiarity about this girl, but Clara can never place it.

                    She doesn't know why these nightmares occur, only that the whispers appear to be calling, calling her to Hollow Pines. Determined to rid herself of these nightmares, and find out why they are happening, she decides to visit Hollow Pines.
                    Upon arriving, she finds a town shrouded in silence, its buildings worn by time and decay. As she explores, supernatural echoes manifest, allowing her to witness fragmented moments from the past and the memories of the people that once called Hollow Pines home. The Hollow, sensing her return, begins manipulating her perception, twisting the environment, and making her question what is real.
                    The truth, however, is far worse than she realizes.
